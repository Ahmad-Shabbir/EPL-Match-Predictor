## Overview

Welcome to Premier Predictor! This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the winner of football matches in the English Premier League (EPL). By leveraging historical match data, we aim to provide insights into future match outcomes, helping football enthusiasts make informed predictions.

## Project Goals

- **Predictive Modeling:** Develop machine learning models to forecast EPL match winners based on historical data.
- **Data Scraping:** Gather match data from FBref using web scraping techniques.
- **Model Evaluation:** Measure prediction accuracy and iteratively improve model performance.
- **Accessible Code:** Organize project code into Jupyter notebooks for easy exploration and understanding.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python:** Programming language for data processing and model development.
- **JupyterLab:** Interactive development environment for running Python code.
- **pandas:** Data manipulation library for cleaning and preprocessing datasets.
- **requests & BeautifulSoup:** Tools for web scraping to collect match data.
- **scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for building predictive models.

## Project Structure

- **`scraping.ipynb`:** Jupyter notebook for scraping match data from FBref.
- **`predictions.ipynb`:** Jupyter notebook for making predictions using machine learning models.
